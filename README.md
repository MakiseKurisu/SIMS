System Requirements and Setup:

	1. Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 

		ELMS WebStores is available for the distribution of Microsoft Imagine software through agreement between University of Houston 		and Microsoft. Visual Studio provided us with a fast and simple IDE that facilitated the coding process.
	
		-If you are UHD students, faculty, or staff, you can use UHD email address or username to sign in and download. 
		Visual 	Studio Community 2015 licensed under Microsoft Imagine program. 
		-Otherwise, you must use VS 2015 (not VS 2017) to work on this project until 
		-If you do not have an account, you can click on "register" or "request an account".
		-Go to this link to download VS2015 
		https://e5.onthehub.com/WebStore/ProductsByMajorVersionList.aspx?ws=c6ac855e-e69b-e011-969d-0030487d8897
		-Install Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition w/ Update 3
		-Restart your computer.

	2. QT

		QT is a C++ based frameword of libraries and tools that enables the development of powerful interactive cross-platform 			applications and devices. QT is open-source software. You do not need to create QT account to download the software.
	
		-Go to this link: https://www.qt.io/download-open-source/ 
		-Click "Download Now" and keep their default settings when installing.
	
	3. QT extension for Visual Studio 2015

		This will allow you to integrate QT with Visual Studio 2015.
	
		-Follow the documentation here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/19wl1C4GbSmPnjDThf_oIKv57EZzoUNInRacnHIcgiQA

		4. GitHub account
	
	Github allows different collaborators to edit and contribute to different parts of the code.
	
		-Navigate to github website: https://github.com/ to create an account.
		-Sign up with any valid email address.
		-You can fork the project, or simply copy the URL to clone the repo.
		-Be sure to learn or know the basics of how to use github and/or git.
	
	5. Github Extension for Visual Studio

		For this project we used the Github extension alongside Visual Studio 2015. 
		The extension helped us collaborate with one another in an efficient manner by letting each of us work on the project collaboratively.
	
		-This can be installed from Tools - > Extensions and Updates area of Visual Studio 2015. Search for "github" and the first result is the one that you want.
		-Restart VS 2015
		-You can clone, commit, push, branch and perform most git functions through Visual Studio now!
