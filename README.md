This text file contains step-by-step instructions on how to use the Student Information
Management System. The client should carefully follow the guidelines. 

=====================
System Requirements:

1. Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 
	ELMS WebStores is available for the distribution of Microsoft Imagine software
	through agreement between University of Houston and Microsoft. 
	Visual Studio provided us with 
a fast and simple IDE 
	that facilitated the coding process.
	-If you are UHD students, faculty, or stage, you can use UHD email address 
	or username to sign in and download. Visual Studio Community 2015 licensed 
	under Microsoft Imagine program. 
	-If you do not have an account, you can click on "register" or "request an account".
	-Go to this link to download VS2015
	https://e5.onthehub.com/WebStore/ProductsByMajorVersionList.aspx?ws=c6ac855e-e69b-e011-969d-0030487d8897
	-Restart you computer.

2. QT
	QT is a C++ based frameword of libraries and tools that enables the development of powerful
	interactive cross-platform applications and devices. QT is open-source software. 
	You do not need to create QT account to download the software.

3.GitHub account
	For this project we used the Github extension alongside Visual Studio 2015. 

	The extension helped us collaborate with one another in an efficient manner 
	by letting each of us work on 
different parts of the code and see the changes
	being made in real time
	-Navigate to github website: https://github.com/ to create an account.
